My personal **[portfolio version -.2](https://theathomo.vercel.app/)**

As everything evolves, here is my new 2.0 brand portfolio, bringing all my essence on one site, clean, simple and at the same time beautiful (my passion). 

I put a lot of effort into this, taking time, knowledge and most importantly, patience, patience to understand that all great things are not done overnight! 
they are built step by step, little by little and in the end, when you don't even expect it, they are more than ready.
